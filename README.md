# Design-and-Implementation-of-Microcontroller-Pins-using-LtSpice-for-single-element-resistive-sensor
The LTSpice does not have its own Arduino box therefore, we used Switches, Comparator, Monostable Multivibrator, D-flip flop, and Pulse Signals to mimic the function and working of Arduino pins. We used Voltage Controlled Switch and give voltage to it in the form of a pulse to make it on or off. The TON and TOFF are selected in such a way that they give sufficient time to the capacitor to get charged and discharged. These values of TON and TOFF are dependent on Capacitor Voltage and are fed to switches using logic.
